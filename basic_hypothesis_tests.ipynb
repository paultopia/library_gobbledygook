Should we believe that the potential jurors were selected from the whole population? P-value means how likely would we be to get the observed distribution from the underlying population.\n\n- Basic idea: Take a crosstabulation (a.k.a. contingency table) of the sample, and calculate what the expected values of the cells in the table would be from the population.  See if they're crazy different.\n\nSticking with our jury example, suppose we had the following data on our underlying population and our jury pool: \n\n|                  | Women | Men  |\n|------------------|-------|------|\n| Not in Jury Pool | 4850  | 4650 |\n| In Jury Pool     | 150   | 350  |\n"

As the name suggests, it produces better estimates than chi-squared, but at the cost of computational complexity, so even today it's rarely used for big contingency tables (you could use chi-squared for a 4x4 table, a 9x9 table, etc.)  Traditionally, Fisher's exact test is used for small samples that are inappropriate for chi-squared. \n\nBut it's never wrong to conduct an extra test!  (Well, it's wrong if you're doing research and you don't report them all.  We'll talk about this later.  Report every damn test you conduct.)  So let's try it on our big contingency table here."
